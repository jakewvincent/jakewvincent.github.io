<p>I am a lecturer in <a href="https://ling.ucsc.edu">Linguistics</a> at UC Santa Cruz and a contract Language Engineer on the AiData team at AWS. I graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2021 with a Ph.D. in Linguistics. My interests broadly include syntax, the syntax-semantics interface, and psycholinguistics, but I am especially interested in the syntax of long-distance dependencies. I am also invested in the use of controlled experimental methodologies to gain insight into linguistic competence and its interfaces with performance systems, especially when informally collected judgments are unreliable or ambiguous.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/760063f3ff8277bc8b1a19ca3f701e6e/">dissertation</a> investigates extraction from relative clauses in English in the context of related work on relative clauses in the North Germanic languages of Mainland Scandinavia (<a href="http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jacques.jayez/Cours/Implicite/Dominance_and_PP_Erteschikshir1979.pdf">Danish</a>, <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2077/51985">Swedish</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.2019.0051">Norwegian</a>), some <a href="http://157.138.8.12/jspui/bitstream/11707/136/1/Koster.Fest.pdf">Romance languages</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00275">Hebrew</a>. With <a href="https://ivysichel.sites.ucsc.edu/">Ivy Sichel</a> and <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers">Matt Wagers</a>, I am currently investigating the influence of transitive verb type and context on extraction.</p>

<p>I also work on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_language">Chamorro</a> (Austronesian; <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@14.4580764,145.4153867,8z">Mariana Islands</a>; 45,000 speakers) and am studying the syntax(-semantics) of the language’s head-internal relative clauses. In collaboration with <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~jpguevar">Jed Pizarro-Guevara</a>, I am also studying the syntax of relative clauses in Bisaya.</p>
