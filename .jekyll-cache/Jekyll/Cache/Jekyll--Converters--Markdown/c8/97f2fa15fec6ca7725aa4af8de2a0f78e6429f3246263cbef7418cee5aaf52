<p>I enjoy teaching materials at all levels but have particularly enjoyed leading sections for Syntax 1 and 2, Phonology 1, and Semantics 1. Helping students understand course material is one of the most gratifying parts of being a teacher, and I appreciate the perspective I gain by revisiting familiar concepts and thinking of new ways to explain them to other people.</p>
