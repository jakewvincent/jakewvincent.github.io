<p>Iâ€™m a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in <a href="http://ling.ucsc.edu">Linguistics at UC Santa Cruz</a>. My interests broadly include syntax, the syntax-semantics interface, and psycholinguistics, but I am especially interested in the syntax of long-distance dependencies. I am also invested in the use of experimental methodologies to gain insight into grammatical patterns and representations.</p>

<p>Currently, Iâ€™m investigating extraction from relative clauses in English using experimental methodologies. I also work on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_language">Chamorro</a> (Austronesian; <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@14.4580764,145.4153867,8z">Mariana Islands</a>; 45,000 speakers) and am studying the syntax(-semantics) of the languageâ€™s head-internal relative clauses. In collaboration with <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~jpguevar">Jed Pizarro-Guevara</a>, I am also studying the syntax of relative clauses in Bisaya.</p>
