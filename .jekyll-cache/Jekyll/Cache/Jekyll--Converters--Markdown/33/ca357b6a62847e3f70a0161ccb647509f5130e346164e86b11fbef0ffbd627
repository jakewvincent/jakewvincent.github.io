  <p>Relative clauses (RCs) are a prototypical example of a strong island, but certain languages have been shown to selectively tolerate RC subextraction (Mainland Scandinavian languages, certain Romance languages, Hebrew, and others). For subextraction to be licit in these languages, the DP that hosts the RC typically needs to be the pivot of a canonical or non-canonical existential, or otherwise non-presupposed.</p>

  <p>It hasnâ€™t been heavily researched whether these patterns extend to English as well, but some research suggests that it does (see, e.g., <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/4178357">Chung &amp; McCloskey 1983</a> and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=DUAIAQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA239&amp;dq=kush+microvariation+in+islands&amp;ots=0ABychxQnB&amp;sig=pgZvVqUa2JsscxB_D05KuZ9fSt8#v=onepage&amp;q=kush%20microvariation%20in%20islands&amp;f=false">Kush et al. 2013</a>). I am currently using experimental methods to investigate whether English also selectively tolerates RC subextraction. So far, I have found that English RCs are substantially more transparent to extraction in existentials, as well as in predicate nominals (as found by <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/690046/pdf?casa_token=wBovu7pEZL4AAAAA:LnyFnb7FGW7T2e9nR6rx_UTE_-qQAHXBSaYbTjXJtR2KEVyCYlXZ7JrQEPMfIEuxqKNf9Otung">Sichel 2018</a> for Hebrew). I have written about these results <a href="/assets/documents/jwv_rc_subext_eng.pdf">here</a>, and you can find my experiment notebooks <a href="/notebooks.html">here</a>. I plan to investigate the online processing of RCs in these environments, and to address the question of whether these cases of improved RC subextraction should be generated by the grammar.</p>

  <p>Chamorro has a typologically rare construction in which a noun phrase being modified by a relative clause surfaces within that relative clause, as shown below.</p>

  <div class="example">
    <div class="all-align-units">
        <div class="align-unit">

  <p>I am researching Chamorroâ€™s head-internal relative clauses in relation to the languageâ€™s head-initial and head-final relative clauses, and am developing an analysis of them that explains their island-sensitivity, the mandatory presence of the linker particle <i>na</i> directly before the internal head noun, certain interpretive effects, and their surface-similarity to stranding patterns in other A-bar contexts. You can read my MA thesis on this topic <a href="https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt0jq7096r/qt0jq7096r.pdf?t=p3qtng">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I am currently working on a syllable parser that takes input in IPA characters and produces a syllabified output. Currently, the function follows essentially the same procedure that students are taught to follow in Phonology 1. It first identifies syllable nuclei (including diphthongs), then parses preceding consonants into the syllable of the following nucleus segment by segment (leaving segments unparsed if they donâ€™t form a legal onset cluster), and finally parsing remaining unparsed segments into the coda of the syllable of the preceding nucleus.</p>

    <p>The program also includes an integration with the <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict">Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary</a>, which contains pronunciations for over 100,000 words. The script converts the ARPABET codes that come with the dictionary into IPA, which makes it possible to look for statistical patterns across English pronunciations and syllabifications.</p>
