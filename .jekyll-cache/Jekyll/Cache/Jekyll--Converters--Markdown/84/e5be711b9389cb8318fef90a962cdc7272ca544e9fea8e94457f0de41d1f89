<p>Currently, I work on the AiData team at AWS as a Language Engineer (contract) in the NLU pod. I help curate natural language data for and evaluate the performance of the <a href="Lex Automated Chatbot Designer">https://aws.amazon.com/lex/chatbot-designer/</a>, currently in preview. I sometimes serve as a lecturer in <a href="https://ling.ucsc.edu">Linguistics</a> at UC Santa Cruz, where I received a Ph.D. in Linguistics in 2021. On the academic side, my interests broadly include syntax, the syntax-semantics interface, and psycholinguistics, but I am especially interested in the syntax of long-distance dependencies. I am invested in the use of controlled experimental methodologies to gain insight into linguistic competence and its interfaces with performance systems, especially when informally collected judgments are unreliable or ambiguous.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/760063f3ff8277bc8b1a19ca3f701e6e/">dissertation</a> investigates extraction from relative clauses in English in the context of related work on relative clauses in the North Germanic languages of Mainland Scandinavia (<a href="http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jacques.jayez/Cours/Implicite/Dominance_and_PP_Erteschikshir1979.pdf">Danish</a>, <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2077/51985">Swedish</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.2019.0051">Norwegian</a>), some <a href="http://157.138.8.12/jspui/bitstream/11707/136/1/Koster.Fest.pdf">Romance languages</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00275">Hebrew</a>. With <a href="https://ivysichel.sites.ucsc.edu/">Ivy Sichel</a> and <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers">Matt Wagers</a>, I am currently investigating the influence of transitive verb type and context on extraction.</p>

<p>I have done work on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_language">Chamorro</a> (Austronesian; <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@14.4580764,145.4153867,8z">Mariana Islands</a>; 45,000 speakers) and have studied the syntax(-semantics) of the languageâ€™s head-internal relative clauses.</p>
