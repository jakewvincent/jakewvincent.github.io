<p>Iâ€™m a recent Ph.D. graduate in <a href="http://ling.ucsc.edu">Linguistics from UC Santa Cruz</a>. My interests broadly include syntax, the syntax-semantics interface, and psycholinguistics, but I am especially interested in the syntax of long-distance dependencies. I am also invested in the use of controlled experimental methodologies to gain insight into linguistic competence and its interfaces with performance systems, especially when informally collected judgments are unreliable or ambiguous.</p>

<p>My dissertation investigates extraction from relative clauses in English in the context of related work on relative clauses in the North Germanic languages of Mainland Scandinavia (<a href="http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jacques.jayez/Cours/Implicite/Dominance_and_PP_Erteschikshir1979.pdf">Danish</a>, <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2077/51985">Swedish</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.2019.0051">Norwegian</a>), some <a href="http://157.138.8.12/jspui/bitstream/11707/136/1/Koster.Fest.pdf">Romance languages</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00275">Hebrew</a>. You can find an earlier manuscript of this work <a href="assets/documents/jwv_rc_subext_eng.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also work on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_language">Chamorro</a> (Austronesian; <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@14.4580764,145.4153867,8z">Mariana Islands</a>; 45,000 speakers) and am studying the syntax(-semantics) of the languageâ€™s head-internal relative clauses. In collaboration with <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~jpguevar">Jed Pizarro-Guevara</a>, I am also studying the syntax of relative clauses in Bisaya.</p>
