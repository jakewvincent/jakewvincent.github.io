I"ø	<p>Hi! Iâ€™m a generative linguist with a background in syntax, semantics, and psycholinguistics. I currently work as a Language Engineer at Amazon Web Services, where I support automated call summarization and theme analysis features for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/">Contact Lens</a>. Previously, I held a contract position on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex/">Amazon Lex</a> team, where I worked on language expansion for Lex and oversaw two performance evaluation tasks for the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex/chatbot-designer/">Automated Chatbot Designer</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m the developer and maintainer of <a href="https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim">MKDNFLOW</a>, a plugin for the Neovim source code editor that enables the fluent navigation and management of markdown-based notebooks/journals/wikis/websites within the editor itself.</p>

<p>On the academic side, my interests include syntax, the syntax-semantics interface, and psycholinguistics, but I am especially interested in the syntax of long-distance dependencies. I am invested in the use of controlled experimental methodologies to gain insight into linguistic competence and its interfaces with performance systems, especially when informally collected judgments are unreliable or ambiguous. My <a href="https://www.proquest.com/openview/760063f3ff8277bc8b1a19ca3f701e6e/">dissertation</a> (June 2021) investigates extraction from relative clauses in English in the context of related work on relative clauses in the North Germanic languages of Mainland Scandinavia (<a href="http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jacques.jayez/Cours/Implicite/Dominance_and_PP_Erteschikshir1979.pdf">Danish</a>, <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2077/51985">Swedish</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.2019.0051">Norwegian</a>), some <a href="http://157.138.8.12/jspui/bitstream/11707/136/1/Koster.Fest.pdf">Romance languages</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00275">Hebrew</a>. A <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/7/2/117">related paper</a> that I co-wrote with <a href="https://ivysichel.sites.ucsc.edu/">Ivy Sichel</a> and <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers">Matt Wagers</a> was recently published in <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/languages/special_issues/Recent_Advances_in_Research_on_Island_Phenomena">a special islands issue of the MDPI publication <em>Languages</em></a>.</p>

<p>I sometimes serve as a <a href="https://ling.ucsc.edu">Linguistics</a> lecturer at UC Santa Cruz, where I received my doctorate.</p>
