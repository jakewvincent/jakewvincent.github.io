Hi! I'm a generative linguist with a background in syntax, semantics, and psycholinguistics. I currently work as a Language Engineer at Amazon Web Services, where I support automated call summarization and theme analysis features for [Contact Lens for Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/). Previously, I held a contract position on the [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) team, where I worked on language expansion for Lex and oversaw two performance evaluation tasks for the [Automated Chatbot Designer](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/chatbot-designer/).

I'm the developer and maintainer of [MKDNFLOW](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim), a plugin for the Neovim source code editor that enables the fluent navigation and management of markdown-based notebooks/journals/wikis/websites within the editor itself.

On the academic side, my interests include syntax, the syntax-semantics interface, and psycholinguistics, but I am especially interested in the syntax of long-distance dependencies. I am invested in the use of controlled experimental methodologies to gain insight into linguistic competence and its interfaces with performance systems, especially when informally collected judgments are unreliable or ambiguous. My [dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/openview/760063f3ff8277bc8b1a19ca3f701e6e/) (June 2021) investigates extraction from relative clauses in English in the context of related work on relative clauses in the North Germanic languages of Mainland Scandinavia ([Danish](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jacques.jayez/Cours/Implicite/Dominance_and_PP_Erteschikshir1979.pdf), [Swedish](http://hdl.handle.net/2077/51985), and [Norwegian](https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.2019.0051)), some [Romance languages](http://157.138.8.12/jspui/bitstream/11707/136/1/Koster.Fest.pdf), and [Hebrew](https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00275). A [related paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/7/2/117) that I co-wrote with [Ivy Sichel](https://ivysichel.sites.ucsc.edu/) and [Matt Wagers](https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers) was recently published in [a special islands issue of the MDPI publication *Languages*](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/languages/special_issues/Recent_Advances_in_Research_on_Island_Phenomena).

I sometimes serve as a [Linguistics](https://ling.ucsc.edu) lecturer at UC Santa Cruz, where I received my doctorate.
