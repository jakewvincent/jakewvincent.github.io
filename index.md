I'm a Data Scientist in [SageMaker AI (Ground Truth org)](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/groundtruth/) at Amazon Web Services, currently serving as the primary implementation lead for the data workflows supporting the [Contact Lens](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/) Applied Science team's development and testing, translating Product/Science goals into annotation and evaluation methodologies, developing and running human- and LLM-in-the-loop pipelines, and driving decisions with statistical analysis, linguistic expertise, and conversation analytics domain experience. Recent work has included prompt engineering for summary generation and evaluation, building a multilingual system for realistic synthetic data generation across multiple channels, and shaping my team's AWS infrastructure and security patterns.
