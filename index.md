I'm a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in [Linguistics at UC Santa Cruz](http://ling.ucsc.edu). My interests broadly include syntax, the syntax-semantics interface, and psycholinguistics, but I am especially interested in the syntax of long-distance dependencies. I am also invested in the use of experimental methodologies to gain insight into grammatical patterns and representations.

Currently, I'm investigating extraction from relative clauses in English using experimental methodologies. I also work on [Chamorro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_language) (Austronesian; [Mariana Islands](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.4580764,145.4153867,8z); 45,000 speakers) and am studying the syntax(-semantics) of the language's head-internal relative clauses. In collaboration with [Jed Pizarro-Guevara](https://people.ucsc.edu/~jpguevar), I am also studying the syntax of relative clauses in Bisaya.
