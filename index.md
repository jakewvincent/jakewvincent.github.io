I am a lecturer in [Linguistics](https://ling.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz and a contract Language Engineer on the AiData team at AWS. I graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2021 with a Ph.D. in Linguistics. My interests broadly include syntax, the syntax-semantics interface, and psycholinguistics, but I am especially interested in the syntax of long-distance dependencies. I am also invested in the use of controlled experimental methodologies to gain insight into linguistic competence and its interfaces with performance systems, especially when informally collected judgments are unreliable or ambiguous.

My [dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/openview/760063f3ff8277bc8b1a19ca3f701e6e/) investigates extraction from relative clauses in English in the context of related work on relative clauses in the North Germanic languages of Mainland Scandinavia ([Danish](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jacques.jayez/Cours/Implicite/Dominance_and_PP_Erteschikshir1979.pdf), [Swedish](http://hdl.handle.net/2077/51985), and [Norwegian](https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.2019.0051)), some [Romance languages](http://157.138.8.12/jspui/bitstream/11707/136/1/Koster.Fest.pdf), and [Hebrew](https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00275). With [Ivy Sichel](https://ivysichel.sites.ucsc.edu/) and [Matt Wagers](https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers), I am currently investigating the influence of transitive verb type and context on extraction.

I also work on [Chamorro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_language) (Austronesian; [Mariana Islands](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.4580764,145.4153867,8z); 45,000 speakers) and am studying the syntax(-semantics) of the language's head-internal relative clauses. In collaboration with [Jed Pizarro-Guevara](https://people.ucsc.edu/~jpguevar), I am also studying the syntax of relative clauses in Bisaya.
