Currently, I work on the AiData team at AWS as a Language Engineer (contract) in the NLU pod. I help curate natural language data for and evaluate the performance of the [https://aws.amazon.com/lex/chatbot-designer/](Lex Automated Chatbot Designer), currently in preview. I sometimes serve as a lecturer in [Linguistics](https://ling.ucsc.edu) at UC Santa Cruz, where I received a Ph.D. in Linguistics in 2021. On the academic side, my interests broadly include syntax, the syntax-semantics interface, and psycholinguistics, but I am especially interested in the syntax of long-distance dependencies. I am invested in the use of controlled experimental methodologies to gain insight into linguistic competence and its interfaces with performance systems, especially when informally collected judgments are unreliable or ambiguous.

My [dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/openview/760063f3ff8277bc8b1a19ca3f701e6e/) investigates extraction from relative clauses in English in the context of related work on relative clauses in the North Germanic languages of Mainland Scandinavia ([Danish](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jacques.jayez/Cours/Implicite/Dominance_and_PP_Erteschikshir1979.pdf), [Swedish](http://hdl.handle.net/2077/51985), and [Norwegian](https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.2019.0051)), some [Romance languages](http://157.138.8.12/jspui/bitstream/11707/136/1/Koster.Fest.pdf), and [Hebrew](https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00275). With [Ivy Sichel](https://ivysichel.sites.ucsc.edu/) and [Matt Wagers](https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers), I am currently investigating the influence of transitive verb type and context on extraction.

I have done work on [Chamorro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_language) (Austronesian; [Mariana Islands](https://www.google.com/maps/@14.4580764,145.4153867,8z); 45,000 speakers) and have studied the syntax(-semantics) of the language's head-internal relative clauses.
