I'm a Language Data Scientist in [SageMaker AI (Ground Truth org)](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/ai/groundtruth/) at Amazon Web Services, currently serving as the primary implementation lead for the data workflows supporting the [Contact Lens](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/) feature development and testing. I translate Product and Applied Science requirements into annotation and evaluation methodologies, develop both human-first and LLM-first data production pipelines, and drive decisions with statistical analysis, linguistic expertise, and conversation analytics domain experience. Recent work has included prompt engineering for summary generation and evaluation, building a multilingual system for realistic synthetic conversational data generation, and shaping my team's AWS infrastructure and security patterns.
