I'm a data scientist specializing in multilingual human language technologies. I have a background in generative linguistics with academic foundations in syntax, semantics, and psycholinguistics. As a Language Engineer at Amazon Web Services, I work on the data side of AI and ML systems for products like [Transcribe](https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/), [Contact Lens](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/contact-lens/), and [Bedrock Data Automation](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/bda/). My role involves collaborating with product managers, applied scientists, and engineers to develop robust data collection and enrichment methodologies that support the development and improvement of AI/ML systems. While I don't directly create customer-facing systems, my work centers around these key areas:

1. Task design (operationalizing annotation and evaluation needs for training and assessing AI/ML systems)
2. Methodology development for the evaluation and analysis of LLM outputs
3. Implementation of data quality measurement and assurance strategies â€” a critical aspect of [data-centric AI](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-data-centric-ai/).

I'm the developer and maintainer of [Mkdnflow](https://github.com/jakewvincent/mkdnflow.nvim), a plugin for [Neovim](https://neovim.io) that enhances the navigation and management of any kind of collection of markdown files within Neovim (notebooks, journals, wikis, pre-rendered websites, etc.).

On the academic side, my interests have included natural language syntax and semantics, the syntax-semantics interface, and psycholinguistics, with a special interest in the syntax of long-distance dependencies. I am invested in the use of controlled experimental methodologies to gain insight into linguistic competence and its interfaces with performance systems, especially when informally collected judgments are unreliable or ambiguous. My [dissertation](https://www.proquest.com/openview/760063f3ff8277bc8b1a19ca3f701e6e/) (June 2021) investigates extraction from relative clauses in English in the context of related work on relative clauses in the North Germanic languages of Mainland Scandinavia ([Danish](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/jacques.jayez/Cours/Implicite/Dominance_and_PP_Erteschikshir1979.pdf), [Swedish](http://hdl.handle.net/2077/51985), and [Norwegian](https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.2019.0051)), some [Romance languages](http://157.138.8.12/jspui/bitstream/11707/136/1/Koster.Fest.pdf), and [Hebrew](https://doi.org/10.1162/ling_a_00275). A [related paper](https://www.mdpi.com/2226-471X/7/2/117) that I co-wrote with [Ivy Sichel](https://ivysichel.sites.ucsc.edu/) and [Matt Wagers](https://people.ucsc.edu/~mwagers) was recently published in [a special islands issue of the MDPI publication *Languages*](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/languages/special_issues/Recent_Advances_in_Research_on_Island_Phenomena).

I have sometimes served as a [Linguistics](https://ling.ucsc.edu) lecturer at UC Santa Cruz, where I received my doctorate.
